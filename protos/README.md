## Differences Between Version 1 and Version 2 of the RobocupSoccerField Proto File

### 1. Changes in External Protos
- **Grass.proto**:
  - No change in the path for `Grass.proto`.
- **RobocupGoal.proto**:
  - Updated to use a Webots URL: `EXTERNPROTO "webots://projects/samples/contests/robocup/protos/RobocupGoal.proto"`.

### 2. Addition of Recognition Colors
- **Grass (Field)**:
  - Added recognition colors: `[0 1 0]` (green).
  - These colors are used in the `DEF BLADES` solid for the field blades.
- **Lines**:
  - Added recognition colors: `[1 1 1]` (white).
  - These colors are used in the `Solid` block containing the field lines.

### 3. Structural Organization of Solids
- **Field and Lines**:
  - `GRASS` and `LINES` are now encapsulated within separate `Solid` blocks:
    - `Solid { name "field" }` for the field.
    - `Solid { name "lines" }` for the field lines.

### 4. Additional Hierarchical Nesting
- **Field Grass**:
  - The `GRASS` block now resides within the `Solid` named `field`.
- **Field Lines**:
  - The `LINES` block is now within the `Solid` named `lines`.

### 5. Minor Adjustments
- **Blades Translation**:
  - The `translation` for `DEF BLADES` remains `0 0 0.01` but now includes recognition colors.
- **Comments and Formatting**:
  - Improved comments for clarity, describing the purpose of new solids and recognition colors.

### Summary of Enhancements
- **Recognition Colors**:
  - Enabled easy identification of field elements (grass and lines) using Webots recognition colors.
- **Improved Modularity**:
  - Field and lines are now separately encapsulated for better structure and potential independent manipulation.
- **Updated Protos**:
  - Webots URL paths ensure consistency and alignment with remote libraries.

These changes enhance maintainability, clarity, and functionality for the `RobocupSoccerField` implementation.
